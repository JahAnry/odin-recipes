        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Sriracha chile sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups tap water, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>3 ounces uncooked cavatappi pasta (about 1 heaping cup)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomato sauce and Sriracha; bring to simmer. Stir in water until smooth and incorporated.</li>
            <li>Stir in pasta and cook on medium heat, stirring often, until sauce has thickened and pasta is al dente, 16 to 18 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in heavy cream; cook, stirring constantly, until sauce coats pasta, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in Parmesan cheese until melted and creamy, about 1 minute. If starting to get too thick, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until pasta has the desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Spoon pasta into a serving bowl and sprinkle with additional Parmesan cheese.</li>
        </ol>
